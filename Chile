<p>New Mexican Hatch chile is not chili but rather a pepper that comes in green and red. <br>
It is a stable of Northern New Mexican cooking.  The red or green sauce is normally put on <br>
the food or you can ask for it as a side.  If you want both red and green simply ask for <br>
Christmas.  Depending on the restaurant sometimes 'green' is hotter and sometimes 'red'' is <br>
hotter and your server can tell you which is milder and hotter.</p>
